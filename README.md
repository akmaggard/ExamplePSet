example output from original coding

This is an example of a slide deck I created as part of a project for a Data Analysis course in Spring 2023. The assignment asked us to collect, process, analyze, and present data in a professional fashion

My project looks at the relationship between [X] and [Y]. I gathered data from [Z]. I did [1], [2], and [3] to clean said data. 

Files for the project include:
- 'mydata.csv' (replication data)
- 'slidescript.rmd' (code for creating the slides)
- 'index.html' (output)
